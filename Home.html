The world gender discrimination describes not only one issue but a variety of issues hidden within the branch. Girls are exposed to the prospect of child marriage, adolescent pregnancy, child domestic employment, poor education and health, sexual abuse, exploitation, and violence as a result of the presence of gender discrimination and social norms and practises. Many of these manifestations will persist unless girls and the gender discrimination as a whole issue are given more value. Boys are also a subject to a variety of gender related stereotypes like,  Men don't do household chores; Men should be the financial providers for their family.
